"(NPS Photo/Wassel)","The structure we now call John Brown's Fort was erected in 1848 as the Armory's fire engine and guard house. The building was described in a June 30, 1848, Armory report: ""An engine and guard-house, 35½ x 24 feet, one story brick, covered with slate, and having copper gutters and down spouts, has been constructed, and is now occupied."" It was in this building that John Brown and several of his followers barricaded themselves during the final hours of their ill-fated raid of October 16, 17, and 18, 1859.

John Brown's Fort, as the structure became known, was the only Armory building to escape destruction during the Civil War. In 1891, the fort was sold, dismantled and transported to Chicago where it was displayed a short distance from The World's Columbian Exposition. The building, attracting only 11 visitors in ten days, was closed, dismantled again and left on a vacant lot.

In 1894, Washington, D.C. journalist Kate Field, who had a keen interest in preserving memorabilia of John Brown, spearheaded a campaign to return the fort to Harpers Ferry. Local resident Alexander Murphy made five acres available to Miss Field, and the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad offered to ship the disassembled fort to Harpers Ferry free of charge. In 1895, John Brown's Fort was rebuilt on the Murphy Farm about three miles outside of town on a bluff overlooking the Shenandoah River.

In 1903, Storer College began their own fundraising drive to acquire the structure. In 1909, on the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of John Brown's Raid, the building was purchased and moved to the Storer College campus on Camp Hill in Harpers Ferry. 

Acquired by the National Park Service in 1960, the building was moved back to the Lower Town in 1968. Because the fort's original site was covered with a railroad embankment in 1894, the building now sits about 150 feet east of its original location.","","2747","1326512","RecArea","295","image","John Brown's Fort in the Lower Town portion of Harpers Ferry","John Brown's Fort","http://ridb.recreation.gov/images/62620.jpg","480"

"(NPS Photo/Wassel)","Thomas Jefferson stood here on October 25, 1783 and described the view as he saw it:

""The passage of the Patowmac through the Blue Ridge is perhaps one of the most stupendous scenes in Nature. You stand on a very high point of land. On your right comes up the Shenandoah, having ranged along the foot of the mountain a hundred miles to seek a vent. On your left approaches the Patowmac in quest of a passage also. In the moment of their junction they rush together against the mountain, rend it asunder and pass off to the sea. The first glance of this scene hurries our senses into the opinion that this earth has been created in time, that the mountains were formed first, that the rivers began to flow afterwards, that in this place particularly they have been so dammed up by the Blue Ridge of mountains as to have formed an ocean which filled the whole valley; that, continuing to rise, they have at last broken over at this spot and have torn the mountain down from its summit to its base. The piles of rock on each hand, but particularly on the Shenandoah, the evident marks of their disruptions and avulsions from their beds by the most powerful agents in nature, corroborate the impression.

""But the distant finishing which nature has given the picture is of a very different character. It is a true contrast to the former. It is as placid and delightful as that is wild and tremendous. For the mountains being cloven asunder, she presents to your eye, through the cleft, a small catch of smooth blue horizon, at an infinite distance in that plain country, inviting you, as it were, from the riot and tumult roaring around to pass through the breach and participate in the calm below. Here the eye ultimately composes itself; and that way, too, the road happens actually to lead. You cross the Patowmac above the junction, pass along its side through the base of the mountain for three miles, the terrible precipice hanging in fragments over you, and within about 20 miles reach Frederictown and the fine country around that. This scene is worth a voyage across the Atlantic.""","","2747","1326514","RecArea","295","image","The view of the Gap from Jefferson Rock","The view from Jefferson Rock","http://ridb.recreation.gov/images/62622.jpg","480"

"Gary Tarleton/NPS/HFC","In 1847, present-day Atlanta was known as Marthasville. The population was approximately 500 and most of the inhabitants were employed by the Western and Atlantic Railroad. In 1848, the town was named Atlanta and in that same year the Atlanta City Council approved the organization of a volunteer fire brigade, which was the beginning of the modern-day Atlanta Fire Department.
 
As the city continued to grow the need for fire protection increased. Indeed, the expansion of the fire department kept pace with the growth of the city - a trend that still continues. The Atlanta Volunteer Fire Department had a long and interesting history and remained a vital part of the city until 1882 when the Atlanta Fire Department became official and the city council voted to pay salaries to all its firemen. 

No annals of a fire department would be complete without mentioning the important role that horses played in pulling the steamers and supply wagons. In 1867, two Norman horses were purchased by Fire Company Number 2 and a new era had arrived - the horse drawn fire engine. The horses were magnificent to watch and they knew their mission well. The smell of smoke would make them run faster to the source of the fire and the sight of flames didn't frighten them. As they galloped over the cobblestone streets sparks would shoot out as their steel shoes pounded against the stones. The horses were used for half-a-century before they gave way to mechanization. The last horse was retired in 1918. 

The first motorized pumping engine was placed in service in 1911 at Fire Station Number 12 on DeKalb Avenue. By 1914, the city purchased helmets, uniforms, rubber boots and coats for the firemen for the first time. The Atlanta Fire Department was integrated in 1963 when sixteen blacks were hired. They were all assigned to Fire Station Number 16 on Simpson Road. In 1977, seven female firefighters were hired.","","13964","1326643","RecArea","295","image","1927 LaFrance Fire Engine","Fire Station No. 6","http://ridb.recreation.gov/images/62739.jpg","480"

"Gary Tarleton/NPS/HFC","Ebenezer was founded in 1886, nine years after reconstruction began. A band of 13 faithful people united under the leadership of the Rev. John A. Parker.  Rev. Parker served as Ebenezer's first pastor at the original site on Airline Street from 1886 to 1894.
 
On March 14, 1894, the Rev. Adam Daniel Williams was called to pastor Ebenezer, a struggling church with seventeen members on the roll. During his first year as pastor he was responsible for adding approximately sixty-five members to the church. Rev. Williams liquidated the mortgage, purchased land near downtown Atlanta on McGruder Street and built a new church. With the continued growth of the congregation, the church on McGruder Street soon became too small. The membership moved their worship services to a storefront at 444 Edgewood Avenue while construction began on the Auburn Avenue site. The current church on Auburn Avenue was completed in 1922. 

As pastor of Ebenezer, Rev. A.D Williams promoted black businesses, urged his congregation to become home owners, and ""get a piece of the turf."" He led them in the battle for adequate public accommodations for blacks, despite Jim Crow segregation laws. Rev. Martin Luther King, Sr. served as assistant pastor to Rev. Williams from 1927 to 1930. Rev. King, Sr. became pastor of Ebenezer in 1931, following the death of Rev. Williams. 

During Rev. King, Sr. tenure as Pastor of Ebenezer he had three Co- pastors. In 1960 his oldest son, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., joined his father as Co-Pastor, giving Ebenezer international stature. Following the assassination of Dr. King, Jr. on April 4, 1968, his younger son, the Rev. Alfred Daniel Williams King, replaced his brother as Ebenezer's second Co-Pastor. Rev. A. D. Kings tenure came to a close at his death in 1970, and was followed by Dr. Otis Moss in 1971. 

The Rev. Martin Luther King, Sr. retired on August 1, 1975 after forty-four years of tremendous service to Ebenezer and the world. Guided by Dr. King's suggestions, the congregation of Ebenezer called Dr. Joseph L. Roberts, Jr. to be its fourth Senior Pastor. Dr. Roberts retired in 2005.","","13964","1326645","RecArea","295","image","Heritage Sanctuary of Ebenezer Baptist Church","Historic Ebenezer Baptist Church","http://ridb.recreation.gov/images/62741.jpg","480"

For the next twelve years he lived here with his grandparents, parents, siblings, other family members and boarders.

Birth Home Tour   

Visiting the home where Dr. King was born and lived the first twelve years of his life is often the highlight of ones visit to the National Historic Site. Unfortunately trying to visit the Birth Home can also be the biggest letdown if you can't get on a tour. By following the instructions below and with a little luck you may get on a tour of the home on your first visit to the site. 

The home was built in 1895 and is on the National Register of Historic Places. The National Park Service (NPS) is steward of this most significant cultural resource.  The NPS is required to employ the most effective concepts and techniques to protect the resource against overuse and deterioration without compromising the integrity of the resource.   For these reasons, tours of the Birth Home are limited.


The Park Ranger led tour is FREE and lasts approximately 30 minutes during which time you will learn about the life of a young M. L. King. The home is open for tours on a daily basis, except Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day, with the first tour at 10:00 am and the last tour beginning at 4:30 p.m.  The tours begin every hour on the hour and are limited to 15 people per tour. 

The tours are filled on a first-come, first-served basis on the day of the tour.  No advanced registration or phone reservations are accepted. Upon arriving at the National Historic Site you should first proceed to the Visitor Center at 450 Auburn Avenue, NE to sign up for a tour. Before signing up for your tour you will be advised as to when the time of the next available tour.  You may sign-up for that tour or any later tour that may be open.  If there is an available tour you will be issued tickets and instructed on where to meet the park ranger conducting the tour.  Should you sign-up for a tour and find that you can not stay please notify a park ranger.  Once you are signed up feel free to visit the rest of the National Historic Site while waiting for your tour.  All other facilities are viewed on a self-guided basis. 

Groups (school, family reunion, youth, etc.) are limited to signing up for only 3 tour times per day for a total of 45 people. After signing up a group, the group leader is responsible dividing up the group and seeing that the people arrive for their tour on time.","","13964","1326648","RecArea","295","image","Birth Home of Martin Luther King, Jr.","Birth Home of Martin Luther King, Jr.","http://ridb.recreation.gov/images/62744.jpg","480"

"NPS/Gordon Dietzman","Designed to aid navigation on the Mississippi River between St. Paul and Minneapolis, the Meeker Lock and Dam was quickly outmoded by the development of hydroelectric power, which required a taller dam.

"NPS-PETR-James Ritter","Coyotes are the most common desert predator mammal living in the monument. Their populations have declined over the past decade due to rapid city development on Albuquerque's Westside and the regional drought. It is rare to see such healthy coyotes in the park so if you are lucky enough to see one or two during your visit, snap a photo but do not attempt to approach them. Remember that coyotes are wild animals and will defend themselves if they feel threatened.","","2888","1326747","RecArea","295","image","Coyotes patrolling their territory.","Coyotes","http://ridb.recreation.gov/images/62836.jpg","480"
"NPS-PETR-James Ritter","The Western Diamondback rattlesnake is one of three venomous species found in the monument. Large male adults can reach 6 feet in length although the average size ranges from 3 to 4 feet. Rattlesnakes are members of the pit viper family, named so because they have a pair of pits between their eyes and nostrils. The pits function as heat receptors that allow the snake to strike accurately at their prey, even in complete darkness. Desert cottontail rabbits, mice, wood and kangaroo rats easily succumb to the venom within a few minutes. They may run a short distance before they collapse. The snake then tracks them down and swallows them whole.

The Western Diamondback rattlesnake is brownish to grayish in color with a row of dark diamonds with light borders running down its back. The last 2 to 4 inches of the tail have a series of evenly spaced white and black rings, commonly known as the rattle, which when vibrated by the snake makes that unforgettable rattling. Once you hear it, you'll never forget it.","","2888","1326748","RecArea","295","image","Western Diamondback Rattlesnake relaxing in the shade.","Western Diamondback Rattlesnake","http://ridb.recreation.gov/images/62837.jpg","480"

"NPS Photo","As capital of the newly formed Confederate States of America, Richmond, Virginia, became the constant target of northern armies. The key to the city's river defenses lay in a small fort only seven miles south of the capital: Drewry's Bluff. 

On May 15, 1862, a Federal squadron steamed around the bend in the river below Drewry's Bluff.  The squadron opened fire on Drewry's Bluff.  When Confederate batteries in the fort replied, the whole vicinity shook with the concussion of the big guns. Southern infantry lined the banks of the river to harass the sailors. 

After four long hours of exchanging fire, the ""perfect tornado of shot and shell"" ended. Federal sailors suffered at least 14 dead and 13 wounded, while the Confederates admitted to 7 killed and 8 wounded. The massive fort on Drewry's Bluff had blunted the Union advance just seven miles short of the Confederate capital. Richmond remained safe.

Drewry's Bluff is one of the 13 units that Richmond National Battlefied park preserves.","","2902","1326774","RecArea","295","image","A cannon on a bluff overlooking the James River","Drewry's Bluff","http://ridb.recreation.gov/images/62859.jpg","480"
